# University of Toronto - Summer 2020
## APS 360: Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

Finally a University of Toronto Mechanical Engineering course offering that aligns with my interests in the merger between Mechanical Engineering and computer programming.

This repo consists of a week-by-week breakdown of the course work and labs from this course.

This course will be taught in Python, and will touch on tools widely used in machine learning like: 

- Pytorch
- Matplotlib
- Scikit
- etc.

Looking forward to learning theory to back my professional experience so far.
